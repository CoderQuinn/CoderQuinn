## About me

An iOS/macOS engineer focused on user-space networking and system-level architecture.

## What I’m working on

- Low-level networking infrastructure (TUN, TCP/UDP, DNS)
- Swift-based system architecture (SwiftNIO, async event loops)
- Building solid foundations before product and UI layers
