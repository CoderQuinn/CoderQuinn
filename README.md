## About me

I’m an iOS/macOS engineer focused on user-space networking and system-level architecture.

Currently working on the networking foundation of a macOS VPN project (QuantumLink),
including TUN-based traffic handling, TCP/UDP flows, and DNS policy design.

I care deeply about correctness, backpressure, and long-term maintainability.

## What I’m working on

- Low-level networking infrastructure (TUN, TCP/UDP, DNS)
- Swift-based system architecture (SwiftNIO, async event loops)
- Building solid foundations before product and UI layers
